# C.R.U.D. and Spring MVC Project
## Student Management System
### By: Daniel Clark

## Purpose: 
The purpose of this project is to get comfortable building a basic web application. There is no persisted data functionality but it is modeled after the basic Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations that many web apps perform.

## Technologies Used
* Spring MVC
* Gradle
* Java
* HTML
* CSS
* JSP's
* Amazon Web Services (AWS)

## Challenges
* Following the connections and understanding what is happening between xml files, JSP's, 	controller methods, and other aspects of a dynamic web app using Spring.
* Writing correct Java logic that functions within the various paths of the app
* Linking CSS into JSP partials


## Future Goals
* Persist data and make use of Session for various users to maintain student lists
* Multiple classes containing different students
* A more useful and visually appealing front end
* Make better use of Test Driven Development (TDD)
* Better logic and error-checking for edge cases
